        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing my education at Istanbul University, specifically in the Department of German Language and Literature. I engage in writing and translation tasks using English, German, and Turkish languages. I'm also currently learning Spanish. <br />Since the August 1st of 2022 I am employed at Guess Turkey’s Istanbul, Nişantaşı store. I am both a Sales Representative and Key Holder at this store. In addition, I also teach German from A1 to C1 Levels. I work with groups of students or single students that I find through my networks and connections. Before my current job, I worked as an English and German teacher at a language course. <br /> Recently, I have taken an interest in coding and web development and I am slowly and surely learning step by step on how to become a web developer and a programmer. I want to become a Fullstack Developer one day. I plan to create a career for myself in the fields of Web Development and App Development, as I am most interested in these fields of programming right now.</p>
